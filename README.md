Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the site.

4. BUILD FOR PRODUCTION

#🧠 HOW THE DOWNLOAD FEATURE WORKS

The download feature leverages two powerful libraries:

html2canvas-pro: Captures a DOM element as a high-resolution canvas.
jsPDF: Converts the canvas into a PDF format with multi-page A4 support.
When a user clicks the Download Resume button:

The modal opens with format options (PNG or PDF).
The html2canvas-pro captures the resume section.
The captured image is passed to jsPDF, which handles page-breaking and final file export.
The file is automatically downloaded to the user’s system.
This export logic ensures your resume maintains clarity and readability in both formats.
